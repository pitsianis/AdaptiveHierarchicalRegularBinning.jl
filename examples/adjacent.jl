# the function neighbors(node1, node2) returns one of tree symbols
# :apart, :coincident, :adjacent
# 
# We use the Morton encodings and the level of the nodes to determine the outcome
# 
# Each dimension is checked separately.
# Two boxes are adjacent if they are not apart in any dimension.
# Two boxes are apart if they are apart in at least one dimension.   
# Otherwise they are coincident.
#
# The meaning of the symbols is as follows:
# :apart : the boxes are not adjacent in this dimension, at least one possibly 
#   empty box is in-between the two boxes 
# :coincident : the boxes are the same spatially in this dimension
# adjacent: the boxes are adjacent in this dimension, i.e. the end of one box
#   is the start of the other box
